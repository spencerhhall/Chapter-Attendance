# Chapter-Attendance

This project will be using R, Shiny, and other supporting R packages to
visually display the chapter attendance records of this winter quarter.

I have been keeping the attendance record in a Google sheet with 84 rows
of member names and 10 columns for each week of attendance. 'x' denotes
that the member was present, 'e' denotes a member has been excused, and 'o'
denotes a member's unexcused absence.

I will be using the direct .csv file downloaded from Drive and will be
using R to clean it, wrangle it, and then display it accordingly.
